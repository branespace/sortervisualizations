# sortervisualizations
A visualizer for various sorting algorithms

This program creates a visual representation of various sorting algorithms.  Items to be sorted appear as a series of vertical lines, with ;arger lines being higher values.  The sort is then animated, and various patterns emerge.

This is a basic learning project with the following goals:
 * Understanding and working with HTML5 canvas
 * Implementing and investigating various sorting algorithms
 * Working with ES6 generators
 
Included algorithms:
 * Bubble sort
 * Insertion sort
 * Mere sort
 * Quick sort
 * Selection sort
